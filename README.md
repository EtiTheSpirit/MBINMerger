# MBINMerger
A tool for No Man's Sky's MBIN format that merges MBIN files.

# CRITICAL NOTE: This program may fail to merge some MBIN files where there's multiple objects with the same identifier somewhere.
I'll work to get this resolved ASAP.

# Usage:
* Run the program via the command line: `MBINMerger <vanillaMBINFile> <mergeFile0> <mergeFile1> [mergeFile2, ...]`
* Run the program by double clicking it to have it guide you through picking the files.

# Credit where it's due:
